# Protacs Sample

This repository contains a Python script `protacs_sample.py` for training a model to predict the Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA) of molecules. The script uses the DeepChem library to create and train the model, and then evaluates the model's performance on a test dataset.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- DeepChem
- numpy

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/protacs_sample.git
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```
    pip install deepchem numpy
    ```

## Usage

Run the `protacs_sample.py` script to train the model and evaluate its performance:

```bash
python protacs_sample.py
